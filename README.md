# Improved TaxoGen: Semantic Taxonomy Construction with SBERT and HDBSCAN

An improved implementation of TaxoGen (KDD 2018) for unsupervised topic taxonomy construction using semantic representation learning, density-based clustering, and recursive taxonomy expansion.

The proposed framework replaces the original Word2Vec–CaseOLAP pipeline with a modern semantic architecture based on SBERT, HDBSCAN, BM25 ranking, and local semantic refinement, enabling the generation of higher-quality topic taxonomies from large-scale text corpora.

---

# Overview

Topic taxonomy construction aims to automatically organize concepts into a hierarchical structure.

For example:

```text
Artificial Intelligence
│
├── Machine Learning
│   ├── Deep Learning
│   ├── Convolutional Neural Networks
│   └── Recurrent Neural Networks
│
├── Support Vector Machines
│
└── Natural Language Processing
```

Such taxonomies are widely used in:

* Knowledge organization
* Information retrieval
* Semantic search
* Topic discovery
* Recommendation systems
* Scientific literature analysis

The original TaxoGen framework introduced an unsupervised taxonomy generation approach based on adaptive term embeddings and recursive clustering. However, it relies heavily on Word2Vec embeddings, K-Means clustering, and CaseOLAP ranking, which may limit semantic understanding and clustering flexibility in modern large-scale datasets.

To address these limitations, this project introduces a semantic-aware taxonomy generation framework based on SBERT and HDBSCAN.

# Main Contributions

Compared with the original TaxoGen, the proposed framework introduces four major improvements.

| Original TaxoGen | Improved TaxoGen         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Word2Vec         | SBERT                    |
| Local Word2Vec   | Local SBERT              |
| K-Means          | HDBSCAN                  |
| CaseOLAP         | BM25 + Cosine Similarity |

## 1. Semantic-aware Embedding

The framework replaces Word2Vec with Sentence-BERT (SBERT) to generate contextual semantic representations for keyword phrases.

Unlike static word embeddings, SBERT captures semantic relationships among phrases and produces more meaningful representations for taxonomy construction.

---

## 2. Recursive Local Semantic Learning

After generating root-level clusters, each taxonomy node learns its own local semantic space.

A local SBERT model is refined using documents belonging to the corresponding topic, allowing the framework to distinguish fine-grained subtopics more effectively.

---

## 3. Adaptive Density-based Clustering

Instead of using K-Means at all hierarchy levels, the framework employs HDBSCAN for recursive taxonomy expansion.

Advantages include:

* Automatic cluster number discovery
* Noise detection
* Density-aware clustering
* Better handling of imbalanced topic structures

---

## 4. Semantic Phrase Ranking

Representative phrases are selected using a hybrid ranking strategy combining:

* BM25 relevance score
* Cosine similarity to cluster centroids

This allows the generated taxonomy nodes to be both statistically important and semantically representative.

```

This preprocessing stage performs:

1. Metadata loading
2. Text cleaning
3. Product document construction
4. Phrase extraction
5. Vocabulary filtering
6. Keyword generation
7. papers.txt generation
8. keywords.txt generation

After preprocessing:

```text
data/processed/
├── papers.txt
└── keywords.txt
```

will be generated automatically.

These files are then used by the taxonomy generation pipeline.

---

# Required Input Files

The framework only requires:

```text
data/processed/
├── papers.txt
└── keywords.txt
```

---

## papers.txt

Each line represents one preprocessed document.

py evaluation/compress_improved_taxonomy.py ^
-root data/outputs/taxogen_tree ^
-output data/outputs/taxonomy/compressed_taxonomy.txt ^
-N 10
```

Format:

```text
taxonomy_path<TAB>representative_keywords
```

Example:

```text
machine_learning/deep_learning    cnn,rnn,transformer,...
```

---

# Evaluation

The framework supports human evaluation following the original TaxoGen evaluation protocol. The evaluation is performed through a web-based annotation interface and focuses on both taxonomy quality and annotator agreement.

---

## Human Evaluation Web Interface

Annotators use a web-based interface to label sampled taxonomy results. The model names are hidden during evaluation to reduce bias.

<img width="1911" height="1017" alt="Ảnh chụp màn hình 2026-05-31 213846" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e75b515b-d4c0-4f47-81e4-0ed07428d0e2" />

Web evaluation interface:

https://gannhan.ituhl.org/

The web interface supports two evaluation tasks:

* **Topic Intrusion**: annotators are shown a group of terms from the same taxonomy node mixed with one intruder term. They select the term that does not belong to the topic.
* **Parent-Child Relationship**: annotators are shown a parent topic and a candidate child topic. They decide whether the child is a valid subtopic of the parent.

---

## Generate Evaluation Files

Generate evaluation files:

```bash
py evaluation/gen_eval.py
```

This script generates sampled evaluation cases for topic intrusion and parent-child relation evaluation.

---

## Run Evaluation

After annotators complete the labeling process, run:

```bash
py evaluation/run_evaluation.py
```

The evaluation script computes:

* **Topic Intrusion Accuracy**
* **Parent-Child Relation Accuracy**
* **Fleiss’ Kappa**

These metrics evaluate both taxonomy quality and inter-annotator agreement.

---

## Evaluation Files

Main generated evaluation files include:

```text
intrusion_gold.txt
subdomain_gold.txt
intrusion_exp_0.csv
subdomain_exp_0.csv
```

These files are used by the web annotation interface and the final evaluation script.


# Global vs Local Semantic Learning

## Global SBERT

Trained on the entire corpus:

```text
papers.txt
```

Used for:

```text
Root-level taxonomy construction
```

---

## Local SBERT

Trained on documents associated with a specific taxonomy node.

Example:

```text
Artificial Intelligence
```

Only documents related to AI are used.

Used for:

```text
Depth > 0 taxonomy refinement
```

This enables the framework to learn topic-specific semantic structures.

---

# Storage Architecture

Source code remains on the system drive, while datasets, models, outputs, and cache files can be stored on a larger storage device.

Example:

```text
SSD
 └── source code

HDD
 ├── datasets
 ├── models
 ├── outputs
 └── cache
```

---

# GPU Support

The framework automatically detects:

```text
CUDA GPU
```

or

```text
CPU
```

SBERT training automatically uses GPU acceleration when available.

---

# Recommended Configuration

## Local CPU Testing

```python
EPOCHS = 1
MAX_TRAIN_PAIRS = 1000
BATCH_SIZE = 16
MAX_DEPTH = 2
```

---

## Full GPU Training

```python
EPOCHS = 3
MAX_TRAIN_PAIRS = 350000
BATCH_SIZE = 128
